    <h1>i. developing assignment 2's homepage</h1>
    <p>
      After submitting the first workbook, I decided to approach the second workbook by further expanding on the early internet aesthetic that I was already exploring. The 'bare' nature of this aesthetic feels like an appropriate way to present the various experimentations that I will be undertaking while still maintaining an overall vibe.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the homepage, I wanted to do something that references the old internet without being too overtly bold or graphic â€” something to set the tone for the workbook while still leaving room for the other pages to develop. I began by revisiting some codes that I developed last year.

      Firstly, in order to apply the ASCII effect in a more relevant way, I tweaked the media source such that the code is going to be applied to a live webcam feedback rather than a set video loop. This was easily achieved using the createCapture(VIDEO) function.

    <p>
      I also played around with different string inputs and pixel sizes to try and find the most optimal combination for the page. Ultimately, I opted for a smaller pixel size as it gives a more detailed image. However, this also makes the output kind of laggy as well, although I don't quite mind the visual effect that it has. Then, in order to make the visual more engaging, I applied the logic that was used for the randomised colour of the monogram sketch to change the ASCII characters' colours every 3 seconds.
