    <p>
     Since my works in the last two weeks were more focused on p5.js, I wanted to dedicate the homepage of week 6 to only CSS and HTML. I started off by sketching out what I wanted the page to look like roughly. Since I was kind of avoiding importing fonts after learning textToPoints, I figured this was a good opportunity to test it out again. Hence, my initial vision was to have a bold font against simple but well-aligned gridding and have the 'week 6' typeface be the centerpiece of the page.
    </p>

    </figure>


  <div class="text-column">
    <p>
      I started off by making a 1x3 grid to hold my content images in and getting the styling and alignment that I desired. I then imported a font from Google called 'Ballet' and applied it onto the Week 6 heading. While I liked how the page looks, I felt that it was stylistically a little bit different from the rest of the site and needed to be iterated more. CSS transformations was also something that I played with while trying to figure out how to make my design interactive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Experimenting with different compositions, I initially leaned toward using a bold typeface to create visual impact. However, I realized that the other two pages on my site don’t necessarily follow the same design language.  As a result, I began reassessing and rearranging the composition in consideration of the overall site coherence. I also started considering the interactive elements of the page and how different assets may appear where.

    </figure>

    <p>
        Ultimately, I went for a simple 2x3 grid layout to maintain a simple look that aligns better with the overall tone of the site. While the layout itself is minimal, I incorporated subtle interactive elements—such as hover effects and small transitions—to keep the experience engaging without overwhelming the viewer. These finer details help maintain visual interest and reflect a more unified design approach across the workbook.
